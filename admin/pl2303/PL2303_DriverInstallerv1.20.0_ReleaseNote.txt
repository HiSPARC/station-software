Counterfeit Warning!!!
=======================
Please be warned that counterfeit/fake PL-2303HX Chip Rev A (or PL-2303HXA) USB to Serial Controller ICs using Prolific's trademark logo, brandname, and device drivers, are being sold in the China market. Counterfeit IC products show exactly the same outside chip markings but generally are of poor quality and causes Windows driver compatibility issues (Yellow Mark Error Code 10 in Windows 7 Device Manager). We issue this warning to all our customers and consumers to avoid confusion and false purchase. Only purchase branded cables that provide technical support and warranty service. Prolific does not manufacture nor sell end-product cables. 


===========================
How to Install Driver
===========================
1. Unplug any PL2303 USB Device first.
2. Run Driver Installer EXE program to install. Wait to finish. 
3. Plug PL2303 USB Device and go to Device Manager to check COM Port number. 
4. If PL2303 is embedded, you might need to restart Windows or rescan hardware in Device Manager.
5. Refer to PL2303 Windows Driver User's Manual. 

NOTE: For silent install, include the syntax "/s" at the end of the EXE installer program. 
For example: "PL2303_Prolific_DriverInstaller_v1.10.0.exe /s"


===========================
How to do Silent Uninstallation
===========================
You need to create ISS response script to run silent uninstall or silent overwrite (update/modify). 

Example of how to create Uninstall script:
1. Copy your SETUP.EXE file to Temp folder.
2. Make sure you already run SETUP driver install beforehand. 
3. Run C:\TEMP\SETUP.EXE -r -f1¡¨C:\TEMP\uninstall.iss¡¨ and choose option Remove in dialog box. 
4. The file uninstall.iss will be created in Temp folder. 

To test silent uninstall:
1. Run ¡§C:\TEMP\SETUP.EXE -s¡¨ to install driver again.
2. Run C:\TEMP\SETUP.EXE -s ¡Vf1¡¨C:\TEMP\uninstall.iss¡¨ to silent uninstall.

=============================
How to do Silent Driver Update/Overwrite
==============================
Example of how to create Overwrite script:
1. Make sure you already run SETUP driver install beforehand. 
2. Run C:\TEMP\SETUP.EXE -r -f1¡¨C:\TEMP\overwrite.iss¡¨ and choose first option (Modify) in dialog box to install new driver (overwrite).

To test silent overwrite:
1. Run SETUP.EXE of old version. 
2. Run C:\TEMP\SETUP.EXE -s ¡Vf1¡¨C:\TEMP\overwrite.iss¡¨ to silent install new driver version.

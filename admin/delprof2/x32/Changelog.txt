================================================

Version 1.5.3

================================================

Version 1.5.2

a) Bugfixes

-  Fixed incorrect messages "not old enough to be deleted" which happened if: profile age < time zone offset
   (for negative time zone offsets larger than one, e.g. the USA)

================================================

Version 1.5.1

a) Bugfixes

-  Version 1.5 introduced a bug which prevented Delprof2 from working on Windows XP. This has been fixed.

================================================

Version 1.5

a) New features

-  Inclusion and exclusion of profile directories

-  Delprof2 now also cleans up these registry locations:
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileGuid\<GUID> [where SidString equals the current profile user's SID]
   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\UserData\<SID>
   
-  NTUser.ini can be used instead of NTUser.dat for profile age calculation. This is useful if your antivirus product regularly mounts user
   profile registry hives, updating their timestamps in the process.
   
-  Delprof2 is now digitally signed

-  Changed license. Please consult the product's website for details.

b) Changed features

-  Delprof2 needs the Remote Registry service on remote computers. Added a concise error message if the service is not started

-  When only listing (not deleting) permissions the text printed on the screen now clearly states that fact

-  The Systemprofile was ignored previously, now it is explicitly excluded (just in case)

c) Bugfixes

-  Profiles with "access denied" were not ignored although that was printed on the screen

================================================

Version 1.0.1

a) New features

-  Added unattended mode (invoked with /u on the command line) where Delprof2 does not ask for confirmation

b) Bugfixes

-  Delprof2 did not work on Vista and Server 2008 due to incorrect OS version checking
